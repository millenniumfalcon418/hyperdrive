## Project Review for Checkpoint
In our quest for the implementation and analysis of a high performance, fast Conjugate Gradient solver, so far we have achieved the following goals:
1. Studied the Conjugate-Gradient algorithm and experimented with the results of running the code in the available library.
2. Wrote our implementation of the algorithm in C++.
3. Tested the algorithm against our custom matrix that was carefully created to be a symmetric, positive definite matrix which is a requirement for the CG algorithm to converge to acceptable results.
4.
