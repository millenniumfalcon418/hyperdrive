## OVERVIEW
Fast, high-performance object tracking is an important vision problem today. It is an important part of many applications today like, autonomous vehicles, video surveillance captured by drones, cameras, video processing and analyisis amongst many others. Tracking helps in localizing the object in every frame in higher level applications. It has piqued a lot of interest due to the need of automated video analysis of videos generated by high quality and inexpensive cameras. With the advent of extremely high performance computers, the need for fast object tracking algorithms is increasing since the compute power is seemingly available.

## THE CHALLENGE
Today, due to the emergence of cameras with much higher capture rates, 240 FPS, the need to have special algorithms has arisen. Many of the existing algorithms are aimed at the established frame rate of 30 FPS and have been observed to perform at a suboptimal level when used against a video of higher frame rates. Therefore, for real time tracking of objects in surveillance captured at such high frame rates, it is imperative that we have a fast object tracker. Another application of the fast tracker is for processing of 30 FPS videos at a much higher rate, like say 2000 FPS.
